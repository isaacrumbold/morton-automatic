# Project Outline

---

## Scope of Work

The main goal is to rebuild the already existing pages (Home, About, Contact) as well as adding a project portfolio page to show case our services and products.

### project portfolio page

This page will include a list of different services layed out in a grid formate. A user can click on a `learn more` button to load more products in that specific area.

#### option:

This might be an area to consider the creation of a tool that would allow you to add and update your own projects in your time.  
**or**  
I could do this my self and you would not have the tools to update or edit this page as you see fit.

   - this would help build my profile and I would not include the editor for the project portfolio page.
